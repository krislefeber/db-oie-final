This project demos some features of a database with a GUI on top to present the data in a user friendly format. This project was a part of the databases class at UWO.

## Development server

Run `sudo npm run setup && sudo npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new Angular component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
